# 📘 My User Manual

## 🙋‍♂️ Hello, I'm Raúl

If you're reading this, it means we'll soon work together! 🎉
Getting to know new colleagues can take time, so I've put together this presentation to help you quickly grasp the essence of how I work and who I am. I'm looking forward to learning about YOU too! 🙌🏻

## 🌟 My Work Style

- I find excitement in change, as it brings fresh opportunities.
- I keep my workday flexible, adapting as tasks and priorities evolve.
- I'm keen on creating great relationships at work and supporting/be supported by my peers! I'm a big fan of creating in-office jokes and helping my colleagues reach their full potential.
- Sometimes I need "focus time" and avoid being disrupted. When this happens, I typically wear headphones—a good hint that I am "in the zone." 😎

## 🗨️ Communication

- I am comfortable with face-to-face interactions, Slack, email, or meetings. In the case of meetings, I appreciate when they have a specific agenda.
- I strive to maintain an easy-going and friendly tone, often using emojis in texts. However, I can sometimes come across as too direct in certain work situations. It's never my intention to offend, so if this happens, please let me know (preferably in private and directly). You'll be helping me improve my communication by doing so.
- My colleagues and friends have described me as a "disruptor" in a good way—I tend to speak up, challenge the status quo, and encourage others to think outside the box and innovate.
- Although I can be talkative, you might notice that I remain silent in group meetings at times. This usually happens because I want to give space to others to express themselves, without inadvertently influencing them.
- I advocate for a blameless culture. Pointing fingers doesn't help anyone; instead, let's focus on understanding the problem, fixing it, and preventing it in the future.
- I dislike toxic communication, whether verbal, written, or even through emojis. This includes passive-aggressive comments that can hurt without reason. I will call out such behaviors if I witness them! 👀

## 🔄 Feedback

### For Good Feedback

I will share it publicly and/or privately, depending on your preference. Feel free to share any good feedback with me in the way that suits you best :)

### For Challenging Feedback

I prefer to give and receive **fierce feedback**, focusing not on the person but on the action/behavior that was inappropriate.
- Be specific, offering concrete examples of what happened and the consequences.
- Try to give feedback soon after the incident.
- Deliver it privately, never in front of others.
- Encourage the person to come up with solutions to prevent the issue from happening again.

This approach deviates from the traditional "sandwich technique" because it can dilute the message, leading to inaction. Imagine being told, "You work great! But actually, you always mess up in the mornings. But hey, you work great!" This can be confusing.

## 🤝 What I Expect From Others

I thrive in environments where there is:
- **Open Communication:** Keeping each other informed helps prevent surprises and ensures we are all aligned.
- **Mutual Respect:** Challenges are easier to navigate when we respect each other's perspectives and skills.
- **Commitment to Excellence:** We all push towards the same goal of quality and innovation.
- **Problem Solving:** I believe that as an engineer, part of my job is to solve problems, not just implement solutions. I need to be presented with problems and given the space to devise solutions.

## ✍🏻 Values and Favorite Quotes

- **Always expect the best intention.** Hopefully, this is self-explanatory :)
- **Practice kindness.** Also self-explanatory :)
- **Remain curious.** Incredibly helpful when disagreements or conflicts arise. Try to be curious without judgment, and learn how the other person thinks and what they expect.
- **Users first.** The driving force for the work we do. We're nothing without our users.
- **Common sense is the least common of the senses.** I prefer to be clear and avoid ambiguity and misinterpretation. Relying on common sense can be incredibly excluding and error-prone.
- **Too many chefs in the kitchen.** Often refers to too many people involved in initiatives, which can result in slowdowns or planning paralysis.

## 🧠 Personality Insights

If you're a nerd on personality tests as I am 🤓, or if simply you're curious about some of the tests I've taken, here we go:
- **DISC:** According to the [DISC](https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc/disc-styles) test, I am equally balanced between **D**ominance, **I**nfluence and **S**teadiness. This has helped me being assertive and decisive, while also caring for people. The counterpart is that it also makes me "harder to read" for some people who don't know me. (I recommend the book [Surrounded by Idiots](https://www.saxo.com/dk/surrounded-by-idiots_thomas-erikson_paperback_9781785042188) that outlines this better).
- **Myers-Briggs:** My latest result was [ENTP: Debater](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality). Quoting their description, says *"Debaters are curious and flexible thinkers who cannot resist an intellectual challenge."*.
- **Six Working Genius:** According to [the 6 working genius](https://www.workinggenius.com/), I am Wonder + Enablement. Their descriptions are:
	- The Genius of Wonder: *The natural gift of pondering the possibility of greater potential and opportunity in a given situation.*
	- The Genius of Enablement: *The natural gift of providing encouragement and assistance for an idea or project.*
